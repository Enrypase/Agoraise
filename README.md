# Agoraise

Agoraise is a community-focused fundraising web app that prioritizes security and transparency. It empowers users to make decisions while adding a new dimension to social media engagement.

## Keywords:

- Community: supporters and followers of a project are directly involved in its life
- Mass Adoption: leveraging starknet support for account abstraction we aim to have zero registration barriers for any user
- Layer 2: definitely not the layer 2 you think. We don't aim to replace any social media in existence. We want to add functionalities on top of it. Allow your SM followers to interact with your project in one **_two actually_** click.
- Transparency: raising money is a challenge for new people. At Agoraise we want the donators not worry about any scams or shady activities. Everything is transparent by design. If the majority of the donators want to have their money back they will have them. Without any fee.
- Semplicity: the last but not least keyword. We don't want to have people taking hours to understand how to donate or raise money. Start to raise money in 5 minutes! As simple as that.

`Work In Progress`
